# WebsiteDarkMode
## How does it work?
Light mode and dark mode switching option on website. Here I am using CSS variables to change theme color. JavaScript will change the theme color by clicking on icon, it will also change the icon from moon icon to the sun icon.

There are not any liks for navigation and social media, that is why when user clicks on the link a photo of the girl is changing.
